## Installation 

In order to run the model NetLogo and a Python installation is needed. Additionally the Python packages scipy, numpy, scikit-image and shapely are required. Additionally, the NetLogo extensions shell and gis are required.

Under Ubuntu systems Python and the packages can be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
pip3 install scipy numpy shapely scikit-image
```



If Python is not installed in the global path, the NetLogo code have to be adjusted in order to find the Python installation.
